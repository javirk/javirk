### Hey, I'm Javier 👋

I'm an AI researcher with very wide interests from [Computer Vision](https://github.com/Moving-AI/virtual-walk) to [Simulation](https://github.com/javirk/Wormhole-simulation). I was the creator of [Person Remover](https://github.com/javirk/Person_remover)👻 and co-creator of [Virtual Walk](https://github.com/Moving-AI/virtual-walk)🏃‍♂️.

Now, I am working on [rendering](https://github.com/javirk/rusterizer) and doing my first steps in [cell simulation](https://github.com/javirk/cme_solver) while learning Rust🦀. In AI, I am interested in Neural Rendering.
